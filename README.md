## Installing

- verify the addon is working by checking the Addons page on character select

## Minor bugs

- Due to TRP3's communication protocol, and it being adjusted for a cross-faction server, you may run into an issue where your chat log gets messages of "You cant whisper someone of the opposing faction". This can be avoided by using [MuteChatWrongFaction](https://github.com/fondlez/MuteChatWrongFaction/releases) using default UI. The warning does not exist or happen with ElvUI and possibly other chat replacement addons.

- As TRP3 alters the world map, a small bug exists in the default UI. When you're in combat and you've got the map open, resizing it using the button next to "Close" in the top right might cause it to break temporarily. Closing and opening the map again should fix this in most cases. This issue is completely negated by AddOns which replace the map like `Mapster`, `ElvUI` and so on.
